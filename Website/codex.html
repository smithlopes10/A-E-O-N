    💫 HOLA SFITIAN'S💫
    <br><br>
    It's rightfully said😌
    Unless you’re continually improving your skills⚙️, you’re quickly becoming irrelevant 💯
    <br><br>
    Hence to help you build up your skills and stay relevant Code-X SFIT is now here with an " Ultimate Guide 🛣️for CP and DSA💻 "
<br><br>
 What is CP? 🤔
<br><br>
Competitive programming involves programmers competing against each other to solve programming questions in a limited amount of time.⏳🧑‍💻The results are judged on the number of questions solved, time spent solving the problems, and other factors, like execution time, program size, etc.🏆
<br><br>
 Why should you  do CP? 📑
 <br><br>
 ▶️Makes you a desirable candidate to major companies
 <br>
 ▶️Helps you solve complicated problems
 <br>
▶️Makes a huge impact on your Resume
<br><br>
 What is DSA? 🤔
<br><br>
DSA is Data structures and Algorithms and a person equipped with strong DSA skills will have better and more efficient approaches to solving a problem than someone who is not aware of DSA concepts.😎🔥

<br><br>
 Why should you  do DSA? 📑
<br><br>
▶️DSA helps in cracking product based company interviews
<br>
▶️Learning DSA helps in writing optimised code
<br>
▶️Efficiency is the main reason why interviews in top companies are focused on DSA as they want people to  design algorithms that can save the company thousands of dollars.
